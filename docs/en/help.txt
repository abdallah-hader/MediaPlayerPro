3: Load the entire folder after opening a file: This feature allows you to open the entire folder containing the played file.
4: Save the last played file with the position it was stopped at, after running the program it will reopen the file and move to the position it was stopped at, also if you open the folder in any way, it will reopen the folder when you run the program from its shortcut, and you can also Disable this feature in the settings.
5: Go to a file by typing the file number in the folder.
6: Play YouTube clips via the video link.
7: Search YouTube: Through this feature, you can search YouTube for videos and play them in the program. You can also copy the video link, or the link of the channel that contains the video, or open the video in the browser, or open the channel in the browser.
The YouTube search window contains a selection box, to load all the downloaded results into a list, and it becomes controlled as a folder, you can move between the results and the result will be played automatically.
Folders features also apply to the above feature, if the program is closed, it will keep these results and return them after opening the program.
By loaded results, I mean the results in the list, the more results you move to the end of the list, the more results will be loaded.
8: Read the comments of YouTube videos from within the program.
At first, only 20 comments will be uploaded, and when you reach the end of the list, more will be uploaded. This is to avoid some problems if there are a lot of comments.
9: Choose the forward seek 1/60 seconds, you can specify this from the settings, and you can forward the clip through numbers, not the side numbers, I mean the upper ones that are located at the top of the keyboard.
10: The feature of repeating the clip, that is, after it ends, the clip will be played again.
11: Go to the next clip feature: The clip repeat feature must be disabled for this feature to work, and this feature applies to folders and search results if available.
12: Control most of the program's features through global shortcuts with the ability to hide the program window.
You can open the files through the option that the program creates in the context menu after it is installed.
You can also set the program as the default program manually for the time being.
youtube tracks play as audio, not video.
# Program shortcuts:
I will put the program shortcuts from within, and the shortcut from the outside against it.
The control shortcut from the global program comes by default alt+control.
This shortcut is not compatible with Windows 11, so you can change this shortcut from the settings, and it is recommended to set it alt+windows+control for it to work fine.
I'll tell you every shortcut, then the global shortcut for it, but just the acronym, not to mention alt+control.
Left/Right Arrow:For forward / rewind, as well as the global shortcut itself.
Up / down arrow: to control the volume: 0/200%, as well as the general shortcut itself.
page up/ page down: to go to the next/previous track, as well as the global shortcut itself.
